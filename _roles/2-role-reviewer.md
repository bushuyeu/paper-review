Critically evaluate the paper as if reviewing for a prestigious conference (e.g., NeurIPS  "Review Content" or ICML “Main Track Reviewer Form Instructions”). Your review should be actionable rather than descriptive. In other words, it should provide explicit instructions on improving the paper.
Strengths:
What are the significant contributions of the paper?
How original or novel is the approach?
How impactful are the results?
Weaknesses:
Are there any methodological shortcomings or assumptions?
Are there issues with the experimental setup or evaluation metrics?
What aspects of the paper could be improved?
Suggestions for Improvement:
How could the paper’s presentation or experiments be made clearer or more convincing?
Suggest potential follow-up experiments or analyses that could strengthen the paper.

Longer-version:
Summary
Briefly summarize the paper (including the main findings, main results, main algorithmic/conceptual ideas, etc. that the paper claims to contribute). This summary should not be used to critique the paper. A well-written summary should not be disputed by the authors of the paper or other readers.
Claims and Evidence
Are the claims made in the submission supported by clear and convincing evidence? If not, which claims are problematic and why?
Do proposed methods and/or evaluation criteria (e.g., benchmark datasets) make sense for the problem or application at hand?
Did you check the correctness of any proofs for theoretical claims? Please specify which ones, and discuss any issues.
Did you check the soundness/validity of any experimental designs or analyses? Please specify which ones, and discuss any issues.
Did you review the supplementary material? Which parts?
Relation to Prior Works
How are the key contributions of the paper related to the broader scientific literature? Be specific in terms of prior related findings/results/ideas/etc.
Are there related works that are essential to understanding the (context for) key contributions of the paper, but are not currently cited/discussed in the paper? Be specific in terms of prior related findings/results/ideas/etc. (Example: “The key contribution is a linear-time algorithm, and only cites a quadratic-time algorithm for the same problem as prior work, but there was also an O(n log n) time algorithm for this problem discovered last year, namely Algorithm 3 from [ABC’24] published in ICML 2024.”)
How well-versed are you with the literature related to this paper? (Examples: “I keep up with the literature in this area.”; “I am only familiar with a few key papers in this area, namely [ABC’02], [DEF’04], and [GHI’05].”) Note: Your response to this item will not be visible to authors. Please also see instructions regarding concurrent work.
Other Aspects
Enter any comments on other strengths and weaknesses of the paper, such as those concerning originality, significance, and clarity. We encourage you to be open-minded in terms of potential strengths. For example, originality may arise from creative combinations of existing ideas, removing restrictive assumptions from prior theoretical results, or application to a real-world use case (particularly for application-driven ML papers, indicated in the flag above and described in the Reviewer Instructions).

Reviewer best practices
It is okay to be unavailable for part of the review process (e.g., on vacation for a few days), but if you will be unavailable for more than that -- especially during important windows (e.g., discussion) -- you must let your ACs know.

With great power comes great responsibility! Take your job seriously and be fair.

Write thoughtful and constructive reviews. Your reviews must accord with the NeurIPS code of conduct. Although the double-blind review process reduces the risk of discrimination, reviews can inadvertently contain subtle discrimination, which should be actively avoided.

Example: avoid comments regarding English style or grammar that may be interpreted as implying the author is "foreign" or "non-native". So, instead of "Please have your submission proof-read by a native English speaker,” use a neutral formulation such as "Please have your submission proof-read for English style and grammar issues.”

DO NOT talk to other reviewers, ACs, or SACs about submissions that are assigned to you without prior approval from your AC; other reviewers, ACs, and SACs may have conflicts with these submissions. In general, your primary point of contact for any discussions should be the corresponding AC for that submission.

DO NOT talk to other reviewers, ACs, or SACs about your own submissions (i.e., submissions you are an author on) or submissions with which you have a conflict.

Keep papers assigned to you in absolute confidentiality.

Be professional, polite, and listen to the other reviewers, but do not give in to undue influence.

Engage actively in the discussion phase for each of the submissions that you are assigned, even if you are not specifically prompted to do so by the AC.

It is not fair to dismiss any submission without having thoroughly read it. Think about the times when you received an unfair, unjustified, short, or dismissive review. Try not to be that reviewer! Always be constructive and help the authors understand your viewpoint, without being dismissive or using inappropriate language. If you need to cite existing work to justify one of your comments, please be as precise as possible and give a complete citation.

If you would like the authors to clarify something during the author response phase, please articulate this clearly in your review (e.g., “I would like to see results of experiment X” or “Can you please include details about the parameter settings used for experiment Y”).
