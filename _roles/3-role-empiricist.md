Empiricist 👩🏽‍🔬 (15 minutes)
Conduct a small-scale implementation or practical exploration of the paper’s ideas or data. Empiricists should aim to reproduce a result and take a next step forward, verifying new hypotheses or extending arguments about the existing claims.
Experimental design:
Clearly formulate the hypothesis you are testing
Implementation:
Clearly describe the aspect of the paper you implemented or the data (source or result) you have processed.
Provide a brief overview or pseudocode of your implementation.
Empirical Observations:
What results did you observe?
How did your findings align or diverge from the paper’s reported results?
Challenges & Insights:
What challenges did you encounter during implementation?
What insights did you gain about the method or model by performing this experiment?
